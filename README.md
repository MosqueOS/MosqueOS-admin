## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

Get an account on [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register). We need this as Prisma requires Replication and this isn't easy to set up on local environment.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

```
npm install
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

## Database

### Running database seed

```
npm run db:seed
```
